        Client side or Server-side?

    <h2>Web Application Architecture</h2>
<p>
The web application architecture describes the interactions<br />
between applications, databases, and middleware systems on the web.<br />
Web application architecture is a pattern of interaction between the web application components.<br />
The way this interaction is planned out determines the resilience,<br />
performance, and security of a future web application.<br />
It is simply an opening a webpage. The user is able to interact with the website.<br /> 
The code parsed by the web browser. This is how web application works. <br />
<br />
In website developing, client-side and server side have different functions.<br />
It all depends on what the web developer need to do because each tool has its purpose.<br />
Although, I know also how to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript and <br />
I'm having fun using it when it comes to designing. But I would rather prefer the server-side. <br />
For writing server-side code, C#, Java, Python, PHP, .NET, etc are used. <br />
And I'd like to use programming languages in web development to apply my learnings.<br />
And what I'd like from this, script on the server can be protected using passwords, <br />
whereas the script on the client side is open to anyone.<br />
Developers said that, Server side scripting is recommended if you need a tight control<br /> 
on the program code, better functionality, and security.<br />
