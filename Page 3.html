    <h2>My Short Biography</h2>
    I really wanted to become a teacher. Teaching those pupils in Elementary because my heart is near with the children.
That's why I want to take the Education course in my college but It wasn't happened. Because I entered in the convent 
to become a religous nun, I need to set aside my plan and follow what Jesus wants for me.
Honestly, since this course is not my chosen course but I need to take it for the sake of my vocation.<br />
I could say, "Obedience is better than Sacrifice."<br />
It's really hard to do the things that you don't want do it or your heart is not with it. <br />
Though for sure I will not become a programmer or anything that is related to my course in the near future <br />
but atleast I could say that I am obedient to my superior.<br />
Our charism in our institution is education. To teach children in Elementary. <br />
Or maybe I could be a teacher in ICT, hoping so.<br />
Everything is can be learned. That's why I am always trying my best and giving all the way I can but I have also limitations.<br />
I'm not good in programming, Honestly I am just always trying hard to be it. <br />
But I am type of a person that is willing to be learned and easily to be taught if I wanted.<br />
Telling the story in my life of being a CS student is really challenging.<br />
There at City College of Tagaytay for I stayed my 1st and 2nd years of college.<br />
At first, I feel indifferent. Knowing that I am computer illiterate. <br />
I'd never used laptop or computer since before in my lower years of studying.<br />
And for two years I've never used any personal gadgets and even using (personal) social media account<br />
And I am not using computer at convent, only at school I can do programming. That's why there's no practice.<br />
And If I have assignment, the only source where I can get is in the library.<br />
That's why my former classmates and instructors are knowing me as a hard core programmer.<br />
For all the people, they are the one who knows how much this course is challenging to me.<br />
But when I transferred to another school it seems I go back to zero, everything is not as usual as I accustomized with. <br />

I could say everytime I fail, receive discouragement, lose motivation, <br />
but there are many people who keeps on reminding me that I should continue.<br />
I am not after the grades but with the learnings that I should deserve.
