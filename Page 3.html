    <center><h2>My Short Biography</h2></center>
I really wanted to become a teacher. Teaching those pupils in Elementary because my heart is near with the children.
That's why I want to take the Education course in college but It wasn't happened. 
Because I entered in the convent to become <br /> a religous nun, I need to set aside my own plan and follow what Jesus wants for me.
Honestly, since this course is not my chosen course but I need to take it for the sake of my vocation.
I could say, "Obedience is better than Sacrifice."
It's <br />really hard to do things that you don't want to do or your heart is not with it. 
Though for sure I will not become a programmer or anything that is related to my course in the near future 
but atleast I could say that I am obedient to my superior.<br />
Our charism in our institution is education. To teach children in Elementary. 
Or maybe I could be a teacher in ICT, hoping so.
Everything is can be learned. That's why I am always trying my best and giving all the way I can but I have also <br /> limitations.
I'm not good in programming, Honestly I am just always trying hard to be it. 
But I am type of a person that is willing to learn and easily to be taught if I wanted.
Telling the story in my life of being a CS student is really challenging.<br />
There at City College of Tagaytay for I stayed my 1st and 2nd years of college.
At first, I feel indifferent. Knowing that I am computer illiterate. 
I'd never used laptop or computer since before in my lower years of studying.
And for more than <br />two years I've never used any personal gadgets and even using my personal account in social media
And I am not using computer at convent, only at school I can do programming. That's why there's no practice.
And If I have assignment, the only <br />source where I can get is in the library.
That's why my former classmates and instructors are knowing me as a hard core programmer.
I've learned to get the source codes and it's output by coding everything from scratch.
For all the people, they are<br /> the one who knows how much this course is challenging to me.
But when I transferred to another school it seems I go back from the very start, everything is not as usual as I accustomized with. 
Now that we are in online class because of pandemic, <br />I have my own laptop for educational purposes only.
Then it was significant for me especially on my course. This time I can cope up with my course 
but still I am having a hard time to catch up with the lessons of my instructor in programming.<br />
But I have also the willingness to learn though I'm not a faster learner.
Since, I've started this course, I should also finish this no matter what.
I will do my best and letting God to do the rest.
Then if I fail, receive discouragement, lose motivation, <br />
I will remember those persons who encourages me all throughout the time especially the I most needed.
In my studying, I am not after the grades but with the learnings that I should deserve.
